This is firmware for a custom CNC laser cutter based on a RAMPS arduino shield.  The control software is [here](https://github.com/warriordog/LaserCutterController), and the page for the entire project is ~~here~~ (link coming soon).

To use the firmware, download and install the [StepperDriver](https://github.com/laurb9/StepperDriver) library and flash with the arduino IDE.  HW / SW settings can be customized in the Config.h and Constants.h files.
